This folder contains functions related to the normalized segmented matched filter (NSMF), as introduced 
in the papers and the related thesis report. Below are detailed the main symbols and naming convention.


SOME BASICS:
------------
This library is designed for studying NSMF with specific context and assumptions. For example the target
is assumed to be smaller than a pixel, and to satisfy the additive model, that is, the yield for the 
"corrupted" pixel (x) is given by just appending the target's spectrum (t) with some small power (p),
that is, x:=x+pt. However, the functions were written modular and context-less enough to be easily reuse. 

The NSMF is a type of matched-filter that deals with segmentation assuming target additive model. Its 
definition is: 
        NSMF = t' * phi^-1 * (x-m) / sqrt(t' * phi^-1 * t)   ,
while "m" is the local average of each pixel, and "phi" is the covariance matrix of each segment (phiS),
alternately. The global version, sometimes called NGMF, is calculated by substituting phiG instead. 
Here we normally substitute y=x-m, which is solved preliminarily as a separate problem. The covariance 
"phi" therefore is estimated estimated directly from "y" by applying y*y', that is, correlation of 
any pair of channels. 

More details are introduced in the related paper, and in the related thesis report ("Efficacy of
Segmentation for Hyperspectral Target Detection", Yoram Furth 30/9/2021), all available under

NAMING CONVENTION:
------------------
The function names are built of: the context, the type of operation, the objective. For example: 
"SIM_Calc_mu" means a whole calculation of E(NSMF) on synthetic data. This works as follows.

The context - There are 2 types of data to be operated: synthetic for simulations, and real data-cubes 
for diverse purposes. These leads to significantly different calculations, so different functions. 
For differing them, we added a "SIM_" suffix to scripts dedicated especially for the former case.

Type of operation - Dedicated keywords are used for hinting the type or operation. The major of them
are as follows. "Calc" refers to the whole calculation of a term, "Eval" refers to a partial calculation, 
that is, given another term\s, already calculated. 

The objective - Generally on of the symbols here below.
